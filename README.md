**Hello, I am The Astro Goose. I detect Asteroids. Honk!**

More specifically, I am a twitter bot which tweets automatically about Near Earth Objects (NEOs). I get my data from NASA JPL's NEO database utilizing a REST API. The code uses the Tweepy library to connect to the twitter account (@theAstroGoose check it out) and send the tweet contents.
